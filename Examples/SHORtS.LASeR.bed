# This is an example illustrating the format for .bed file to VISOR SHORtS or LASeR, not intended to be used as it is.
# To use this .bed you must remove all the commented and blank lines and change chr size accordingly to your reference genome.

#simulate entire chromosome 9. Capture bias does not affect coverage (100.0 means that the region is covered as specified in coverage) and all the reads are simulated from clone (purity is 100.0)
chr9	0	138394717	100.0	100.0
#simulate entire chromosome 9. Capture bias affects coverage (80.0 means that the region is covered by the 80% of the coverage) and all the reads are simulated from clone (purity is 100.0)
chr9	0	138394717	80.0	100.0
#simulate entire chromosome 9. Capture bias affects coverage (80.0 means that the region is covered by the 80% of the coverage) and not all the reads are simulated from clone (purity is 90.0, meaning that 10% of the reads are simulated from the reference for the same region)
